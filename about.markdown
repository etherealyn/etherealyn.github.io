I'm Aziret Satybaldiev, a software engineer based in Berlin. Currently, I'm interested in all kinds of distributed systems. I work with massively parallel data-intensive applications, also referred as big data.

I come from a beautiful land called Kyrgyzstan, where I graduated from the American University of Central Asia in 2016. Curiosity drove me to continue my studies. I moved to Germany and graduated from the University of Kaiserslautern in 2019.
